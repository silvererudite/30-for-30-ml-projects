# Supervised learning with NN
Nns have gotten quite good at common and hard supervisewd learning tasks such as predicting house prices from set of input features such as no. of bedrooms etc, predicting if a user will click on an ad from user info, photo tagging by using images as inputs and outputting objects detected. 

It turns out there are different kinds of NNs suited for those different tasks. CNNs for images, RNNs for sequential data. 

ML is also applied to both structured data e.g data in databases, features have well defined meaning such as a table of users and their different features such as age, education etc and their income and unstructured data where features don't ususally have a well defined meaning such as images, audio. Machines unlike humans are bad at interpreting unstructured data. Due to rise of NNs machines have gotten better at understanding them.
